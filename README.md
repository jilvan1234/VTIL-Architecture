# VTIL Architecture

## [1) What is VTIL?](https://vtil.org/repo/common)

## 2) What is this repostiory?

This repository contains everything related to the VTIL's Architecture definitions and low-level properties.

Components are likely incomplete as initial release is not done yet, and documentation and FAQ will be on this README file and the organization website once they're done.

Until the initial release you can keep up to date with the VTIL project by checking my [personal twitter account](https://twitter.com/_can1357) or the VTIL website [vtil.org](https://vtil.org/).
